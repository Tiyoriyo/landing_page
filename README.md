Honestly, this project was really fun, but quite hard at the same time. After going through many lessons, and flexbox exercises, this landing page project was a test to what I had learned. I became more proficient with CSS styles, and by the end of the project, I understand flexboxes more than I did before. They are still tricky, but after completing this project I am able to evaluate a structure plan, and determine where I can fit a flexbox.
